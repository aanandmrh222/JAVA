/*
1. They allow you to write flexible and reusable code by enabling types (classes and
   interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods.
2. Generics provide compile-time type safety by allowing you to enforce that certain
   objects are of a specific type.
3. With generics, you donâ€™t need to cast objects because the type is known.
4. Generics are denoted by angle brackets <>, e.g., List<String> means a list of strings.
5. Diamond Operator: Introduced in Java 7, the diamond operator <> allows you to infer the
   type parameter from the context, simplifying instantiation of generic classes.
